    <h1 class="text my-5 mx-3  text-center bg-secondary fst-italic ">STILL I RISE</h1>
    <div class="container bg-danger-subtle">
        <p>You may write me down in history With your bitter, <span class="h3 fst-italic">twisted</span> lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise.
        </p><br>
        <p class="h5 fst-italic  bg-info ">You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise.
        </p>
        <p class="container1 fst-italic fw-semibold bg-warning">Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room.
        </p>
        <p>Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise.
        </p>
        <p><span class="baby fw-bolder bg-danger">Did you want to see me broken?</span> Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops. Weakened by my soulful cries.</p>

        <p>Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own back yard.</p>

        <p class="parent fst-italic fw-bolder bg-success">You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise.</p>

        <p>Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise <span class="grandchild fw-semibold p-1 mb-5 bg-body-tertiary ">That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs?</span></p>

        <p class="h2 fst-italic bg-dark-subtle">Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously
            <span class="row bg-warning">clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope of the slave. I rise I rise I rise.</span>
        </p>
